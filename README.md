## Embedded H2 Database
I changed postgres DB to embedded h2. I added all the required application properties.
In order to access H2 you need to go to <base_url>/h2-console.

## Actuator
In order to access enpoints for health check you need to go to <base_url>/actuator

## Swagger Ui
In order to access enpoints for health check you need to go to <base_url>/swagger-ui.html

Except from the above I changed some code from the initial-skeleton code mostly regarding
Mappers.
